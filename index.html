          graphical user interface on top of MS DOS. All features of MS DOS were later integrated in Windows 95 release. It was a huge success in and led to Windows transition.

              default user interface is usually graphical, although the CLI is commonly available through terminal emulator windows or on a separate virtual console.
              CLI shells are text-based user interfaces, which use text for both input and output. The dominant shell used in Linux is the Bourne-Again Shell (bash), originally developed for the GNU project. Most low-level Linux components, including
              various parts of the userland, use the CLI exclusively. The CLI is particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks and provides very simple inter-process communication.

            <td>Window interfaces" refers to the commonly used way to organize a computer monitor's screen space for interaction with a human user. Screen space is organized into regions called "windows." Each window utilizes some screen space for
              computer–human interaction. Typically, a computer system with window interfaces also supports the mouse and the keyboard as interactive devices for user input.There are various styles of organizing the windows on a screen. One approach
              is to treat the screen as a desktop and the windows as documents on the desktop. The windows may overlap one another so that some windows partially or completely obscure other windows. Only those windows that stay on top are fully
              visible. Users can use the mouse to drag the windows around on the screen or to bring a certain window to the top.

            <td>Mac uses aqual graphical user interface with water-like elements, in the first major release of Mac OS X. Every window element, text, graphic, or widget is drawn on-screen using spatial anti-aliasing technology. ColorSync, a
              technology introduced many years before, was improved and built into the core drawing engine, to provide color matching for printing and multimedia professionals. Also, drop shadows were added around windows and isolated text elements
              to provide a sense of depth. New interface elements were integrated, including sheets (dialog boxes attached to specific windows) and drawers, which would slide out and provide options.

              The use of soft edges, translucent colors, and pinstripes, similar to the hardware design of the first iMacs, brought more texture and color to the user interface when compared to what Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X Server 1.0's
