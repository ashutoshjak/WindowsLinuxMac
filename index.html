        <p class="py-3"> <span class="pl-5">T</span>he first version of Windows OS is released in 1985 which is a simple GUI, an extension of existing disk operating system (MS-DOS) and major release as my point of view was 1995 consumer release
          which has integrated windows and DOS with
          built-in internet support. Most of the PC are currently running on the Windows operating system only. The latest Windows OS version is Windows 10 which is currently ruling the market.Windows was first released in 1985. It was supposed to be graphical user interface on top of MS DOS. All features of MS DOS were later integrated in Windows 95 release. It was a huge success in and led to Windows transition.

It was released in 1991 and designed for GNU developers. GNU developers later integrated it into Linux. It is open to consumers and everyone can use as per their specifications.

It runs UNIX applications as well as older Mac applications.This operating system from Apple stands older than Windows. It was first released in 1984. It began as a graphical user interface right from its inception. In 2005 the design and structure of MAC OS was changed to Intel x86 based architecture.
