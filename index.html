          built-in internet support. Most of the PC are currently running on the Windows operating system only. The latest Windows OS version is Windows 10 which is currently ruling the market.Windows was first released in 1985. It was supposed to be
          graphical user interface on top of MS DOS. All features of MS DOS were later integrated in Windows 95 release. It was a huge success in and led to Windows transition.
